# toasterscripts
A repository for all my scripts made with either Notepad, Notepad++ or Visual Studio, in which you can download all the code because all the  code is open-source and avaliable for anyone to download. So please enjoy these scripts. I have made a Testbench branch to enable me to upload prototypes of projects or ideas.
